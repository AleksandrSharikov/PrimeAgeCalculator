# PrimeAgeCalculator
This application searches for the nearest next year where the user's age will be a prime number (2, 3, 5 ... and so on), based on entered year of birth. 
I didn't put any restrictions on entered age, assuming that it can be used not only personally, but also to calculate this value for persons who lived in the past or will live in the future. 
If a negative value is entered it is assumed as date B.C.. 
If an entered year is after the current one, it is assumed that man will be born in that year, for this reason, the nearest year with prime age for him will be when he turns two. 
This app was written in Java (19, but can be used in any version past 15) and contains only one file, so it can be simply run in any Java IDE, or on any machine with installed JRE from the terminal. 
To exit this app, type "exit" in the console instead of birth year.
